🔐 1. Encapsulation

Encapsulation is the concept of protecting object data by making fields private and providing controlled access through getters and setters.

✔ Example
BankAccount account = new BankAccount("Ahmed Arnab", new BigDecimal(10));
account.withdraw(new BigDecimal(11));
account.withdraw(new BigDecimal(4));


The BankAccount class hides sensitive fields such as ownerName and balance.
This ensures:

Data cannot be modified directly.

All changes (like withdrawing money) go through validation logic inside methods.

🧬 2. Inheritance

Inheritance allows one class to inherit properties and behaviors from another.

✔ Example
Programmer programmer = new Programmer(
        "Ahmed",
        22,
        "New Hargeisa",
        "Java and Javascript",
        programmingLanguages
);


Here:

Programmer extends a base class (e.g., Employee).

It inherits fields such as name, age, location.

It adds more specific behavior, such as writeSomeCode().

🧱 3. Abstraction

Abstraction means hiding complexity and exposing only essential functionality.

✔ Example
Animal dog = new Dog("Jay");
Animal cat = new Cat("Milana");


Animal is an abstract class.

It cannot be instantiated.

It defines abstract methods like makeSound() that subclasses (Dog, Cat) must implement.

This forces consistent behavior while hiding implementation details.

🎭 4. Polymorphism

Polymorphism enables objects of different types to be treated the same way through a common interface or superclass.

✔ Example 1 — Animals
Animal dog = new Dog("Jay");
Animal cat = new Cat("Milana");

cat.makeSound();  // Cat-specific sound
dog.makeSound();  // Dog-specific sound


Both are treated as Animal, but each behaves differently.

✔ Example 2 — Extractor Reports
ExtractorReport extractorReport = new NumberExtractorReport();
ExtractorReport emailExtractor = new EmailExtractor();

emailExtractor.prepareAndSendReport(getFile());
extractorReport.prepareAndSendReport(getFile());


EmailExtractor and NumberExtractorReport both extend or implement ExtractorReport.

They share the same interface/methods but provide different implementations.

At runtime, Java decides which implementation to execute → dynamic polymorphism.

This makes your code flexible and easy to extend.
